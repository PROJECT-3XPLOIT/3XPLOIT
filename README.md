# Overview üìñ 

> Exploit is initially designed and built for college course work (PRJ 666), but is open source and can be used by anyone who wants to learn more about cybersecurity. 

Exploit is a educational cybersecurity game that is primarily built with [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) and [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) using Handlebars. 

This purpose of this game is to allow people to learn about basic cybersecurity in a fun and engaging way. This is an educational multiple choice questions 
game that allows people to have fun while they use their judgement to answer the questions.
The game describes a fictional city called Cursor City. Users are expected to complete each cybersecurity module to save the city from cyber criminals. 

The concept of the game is a 3D robot jumping over buildings after each question displayed has been answered correctly. The game is designed to be a learning tool for cybersecurity and is meant to be played by people who have little to no experience in cybersecurity.
