            The city is experiencing a massive brute force attack on the cursor e-commerce platform. Millions of
            customers
            are affected. Customers used the same password across multiple platforms and a lot of them used weak
            password
            that were easily guessed.
            Brute force attack is a type of cyberattack where attackers guess the password to gain access to personal
            accounts of users. They use a lot of sophisticated software and tools to do the guesswork for them quickly
            and
            efficiently.
