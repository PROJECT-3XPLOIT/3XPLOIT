          The city is experiencing a massive brute force attack on the cursor e-commerce platform. Millions of
          customers
          are affected. Customers used the same password across multiple platforms and a lot of them used weak
          password
          that were easily guessed.
          Brute force attack is a type of cyberattack where attackers guess the password to gain access to personal
          accounts of users. They use a lot of sophisticated software and tools to do the guesswork for them quickly
          and
          efficiently.
